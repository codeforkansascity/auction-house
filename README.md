# auction-house

One of the most popular datasets on KCMO's Open Data Portal is the 
monthly listing of vehicles that are being auctioned off. After 
vehicles are towed they end up on the City tow low. From there, the
owner and lean holder are notified multiple times to retrieve their 
vehicle. If the vehicle is not retrieved in time the automobile
will be auctioned off. Auctions happen once a month and revenues
go towards supporting the tow operation, reducing the tax burden
on citizens. Currently, auctions are listed as a table via PDF.
This project seeks to find a better way to display this informations
so that the public has an easier time browsing the list of vehicles.
A CSV of the PDF will be provided to build something off of.
